      <h3>Forms</h3>
      <p>Forms are made up of the form element, input fields, menus, and buttons.  Usually
        the information is processed on the back end using PHP or Ruby, but is becoming more
        common to process the form on the front end using JavaScript.  Each form control has a
        value that can be specified in the HTML code, the value can be changed by the user entering
        information or interacting with the form's interface.  The value can also be changed
        dynamically using JavaScript.  The method form.submit() will submit the form automatically,
        or the form can be submitted manually by the user employing the button or input element, or
        an element with a type attribute of image.  The method form.reset() will reset all the
        form control back to their initial values.  A button with a type attribute of reset can
        also be used without additional scripting - button type='reset'>Reset close button.  Can set
        a focus event on an element so that the cursor is placed inside the element.
        <div>Form Controls - input fields: text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, file
        uploads - text is for a short piece of text like a username. Using the input type of
        password and the characters are concealed to be unreadable on the screen. - select 
        menus: drop-down lists of options - textarea: element for longer text entry - button: elements 
        for submitting and resetting forms.  Input fields with type='hidden' will not be displayed
        by browser, but can be seen in code.  To upload files use with input field type='file'.
        Other types are: number, tel, color.
        </div>
        <div>Form Validation - checks to see if the user entered the information into the form correctly.
        Examples: required field is completed, email address is valid, number is entered when
        numerical data is required, password has at least the minimum numbers of characters.  You may
        have to validate many different elements to various rules, makes sense to write more
        generic addError() amd removeError() functions.  You can disable the submit button if there
        are errors on the form.
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>Three concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.  Encapsulation
        has inner workings kept hidden.  It keeps all programming logic inside and object (like
        the juicer).  Polymorphism is same process can be used for different objects, various
        objects can share the same method (like other appliances in kitchen have on button).
        Inheritance is taking the features of one object and then add some new features, take an
        object that exists and inherit all its properties and methods and then improve the
        functionality (like getting a new juicer).
        <div>Constructor function - defines the properties and methods of an object.  Keyword this
        is used to represent the object.  To make a property private, use an underscore before
        the propery name (like _color).  These properties can't be accessed outside of their scope.
        </div>
        <div>Getters and Setters - object properties can have a get() or a set() method instead
        of a value attribute, but they can only have one or the other, not both.  These are useful
        if a property relies on the value of another property (like retirement age).
        </div>
        <div>Mixins - way to add properties and methods from one object to another without using
        inheritance.  Can have more complex objects by mixing basic object together.  Use the
        Object.assign() method.  To avoid a shallow copy, use the mixin() function to assign
        all properties of one object to another.  Allows the adding of a large number of properties
        all at once, instead of one at a time.  Can also use copy() method to make an exact, deep
        copy.  It takes a parameter of target of the object to be copied.  Way to think about
        the difference of prototypal inheritance and inheritance from mixin objects is to conside
        whether an object is something or it has something.  (Is - tank or soldier, has - gun)
        </div>
        <div>Chaining Functions and Binding this - if a method returns this, the methods can be
        chained together to form a sequence - like superman.fly().move().xray(); makes it harder
        to debug.  When this is a nested function, the value of this loses its scope.  The solution
        is to set the variable that = this before the nested function and using the arrow function.
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Modular Javascript - Modern Javascript</h3>
      <p>Module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can be
        used in other files and by other modules.  It keeps the code organized in separate, reusable
        files which improves mantainability.  A module's code should have a single purpose, then
        group functions with distinct functionality.  Can select which values or functions to import.
        When lots of values and functions need to be imported, use the wild card symbol * with a 
        namespace.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>On forms, I know that the input has to have a name field, why do we have multiple
        parts of the input field that just repeat the same name?  For example - input type=
        'password' name='realName' id='realName'.  Is there other ways to create these parts of
        the form without repeating 'realName'?  How often are new syntax established?  Does older
        syntax still work or will the programming have to be updated?  Are encapsulation, polymorphism, 
        inheritance, and prototypes only used when you program using classes?  There were many
        methods and functions with little nuisances in this reading that I'm not sure that I will
        remember if I don't use them all the time.  How do I remember all of this or am I forced
        to look it up every time?
