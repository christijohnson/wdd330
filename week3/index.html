    <h3>Object Methods: this</h3>
    <p>Entities are represented by objects, actions are represented by functions.  A function
        that is a property of an object is called its method.  To access the object, a method
        can use the keyword this.  It has no value until it is called.  Arrow functions have 
        no this, instead they use the outer context.

      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>Everything in JavaScript is one of six data types: strings, numbers, booleans, symbols,
        undefined, null, or objects.  An object is a set of related values and functions.  It
        is like a dictionary, you look up a property name and see a value.  They can encapsulate
        code that can be reused, can inherit properties for other objects.  Objects often used
        to keep related information/functionality together in the same place.
        <div>Object literal - wrapped all properties and methods in curly braces, allow
            object to be created quickly and without needing to define a class, great way to 
            organize code.  Properties include key-value pairs separated by commas.  If property
            name doesn't follow rules, like a space, need to include quote marks, and must be
            accessed using bracket notation.  Usually you name using underscore or CamelCase.  
            Shorthand way of creating object is const ironMan = { name, realName};</div>
        <div>Nested objects - objects can contain other objects, such as an object
            can contain a list.  Use the dot notation or bracket notation to access.</div>
        <div>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation, string representation of the object literal
            notation with these differences:  property names must have double quote; allowed
            values are "strings", numbers, true, false, null, arrays, objects; functions can't
            be values.  Great because human and machine can read them!  Method parse() returns
            JavaScript object.  Method stringfly() returns string of JSON data.</div>
        <div>Math object - built in with several properties of common math operations.
            All are immutable. Constants are named in capital letters:  Math.PI, .SQRT2, etc.
            Also Math methods, Absolute values Math.abs(), Rounding Math.ceil() round up to next
            integer, Math.floor() round down to next integer, Math.round() round to nearest integer,
            Math.trunc() returns only integer part, Math.exp() raise a number to power or Math.pow()
            method raise number of first argument to power of the second argument, Math.sprt() returns
            square root of number, Math.cbrt() returns cube root, Math.max() returns maximum number,
            Math.min() return minimum number, Math.random() create generate random number between 0
            and 1, exclusive.</div>
        <div>Date object - use const today = new Date(); to see date use today.toString() to
            return date/time stamp.  Can be written in variety of formats.  Use getter methods
            to return information.  Some are:  getDay(), getUTCDay(), getDate(), getMonth(), 
            getFullYear(), getHours(), getMinutes(), getTime()</div>
        <div>Character groups - groups of characters can be placed together in square brackets
            and represents any one of the characters.  Sequence of characters have a dash between
            first and last characters [A-Z].  Place a ^ at begining negates the sequence so that
            [^A-Z] means it isn't a capital letter. Or combinations: [Jj][aeiou]v[aeiou] will be
            words like Java or jive.  Pattern only looks for first occurance, use global g to return
            all patterns.  Case sensitive, use ignoreCase i to be case-insensitive.  Patterns will
            stop at the end of line, use multiline m to negate.
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
      <p>The DOM allows you to access elements on a web page and enable interaction with the page
        by - adding and removing elements, changing the order, contant and attributes of the elements,
        and by changing how they are styled.  Nodes of the DOM have numerical code assigned to
        signify with type: 1 - element, 2 - attribute, 3 - text, 8 - comment, 9 - body.  Shortcut
        methods of DOM are: Document.body - return body element, Document.images - returns list of
        images in the doc, Document.links - returns list of 'a' and 'area' elements with a href
        attribute, Document.anchors - returns list of 'a' elements with a name attribute,
        Document.forms returns a list of all forms in the doc.
        <div>Get elements - use getElementById() reference the unique id in the argument,
        these should be unique to just one element.  Use getElementsByTagName() give list of all of
        the items (ie 'li') and use the index notation to find each individual item.  Use
        getElementsByClassName() to return list items assigned with the same class name.</div>
        <div>Query selectors - use document.querySelector() use CSS notation to find the first
        element that matches.  Using document.querySelectorAll() uses CSS notation to find them all.
        </div>
        <div>Attributes - the method to return the value of an attribute is gettAttribute(),
        to change the attribute use setAttribute(attribute name, new value).  You can also add new
        attributes.</div>
        <div>Dynamic Markup - create new elements and add them to a page, or edit or remove
        elements that exist.  The method createElement() takes a tag name as parameter and returns
        that element.  In console, const flash = document.createElement('li'); to add content
        create a text node which the parameter is a string containing the text.  Like 
        const flashText = document.createTextNode('Flash');  Next you append the two using the
        appendChild() method, flash.appendChild(flashText); - this is better writen as
        const flash = document.createElement('li'); flash.textContent = 'Flash'; - easier to
        create a function if repeated.  The function will perform the two steps.
        function createElement (tag, text) { const el = document.createElement(tag);  el.textContent
        = text;  return el }, then new elements can be created using const aquaman = 
        createElement('li', 'Aquaman');  - innerHTML returns all the child elements as a string.
        It is also writable and can place HTML inside an element.  It saves time and can be as simple
        as h1.innerHTML = 'Suicide Squad'; and can be used to insert a large amount of HTML as
        a string instead of repeating for each element.
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>Events provide the link between the web page and user interactions. Like when they
        click on a link, press a key, or move a mouse - an event occurs, then the program can
        detect it and respond to it.
        <div>Event Listeners - set a notification to alert you to when something happens, then
        program what to do when it happens. Method addEventListener() will attach an event listener
        to the document's body.  The first parameter is the type of event, the second is the
        callback function to invoke. addEventListener('click', () => alert('You Clicked!')); or
        use named function - function doSomething() { alert('You Clicked!'); } addEventLister('click',
        doSomthing);
        </div>
        <div>Event Object - when an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function
        is called, it is automatically passed an event as a parameter. Types can be - click, mousedown,
        mouseup, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout.  There are keyboard events - keydown, keypress,
        keyup.  Other devices use touch events - touchstart, touchend, touchmove, touchenter,
        touchleave, touchcancel.
        </div>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>I read how you use the keyword "this" to call or invoke an object, but I haven't ever used
        this keyword in any other classes.  Is this a commonly used method?  I didn't understand 
        the section on special characters and modifiers.  When is this used?  Is it only for searching 
        for characters in objects?  Or are these used to validate characters inputted through forms, or both?
        How do you program event listeners and their types for web pages that can and will be used
        for mobile devices (touch events) and computers (click events and keyboard events)?
