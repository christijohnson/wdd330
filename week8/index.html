      <h3>Transforms and Transistions</h3>
      <p>Transforms - this property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on
        the webpage.  The value of the transform property is that more than one transform function 
        (separated by spaces) will be applied in the order they're provided.  
        <div>Translation - this function allows you to move elements left, right, up, or down.  It's 
            behavior is like position: relative and declaring top and left.  Using the translation 
            function moves elements without impacting the flow of the document.  The function 
            translate(x,y) moves and element x from the left and y from the top. (transform: translate(45px,
             -45px)).  Transforms don't work on inline elements, just add display: inline-block to your 
             style.</div>
        <div>Scaling - the function scale(x,y) scales the element for the fators horizontally then 
            vertically.  If only value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y, to grow or 
            shrink your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. (To keep
            same size - scale(1), double - scale(2), to half - scale(0.5)).  You can also use the functions 
            scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) which will only scale the horizontal or vertical dimensions.  The 
            scaled element will shrink or grow toward their center, the element center will stay in the 
            same place.</div>
        <div>Rotation and Skew- this function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specific 
            angle value. (transform: rotate(10deg)).  The function skew(x,y) specifics a skew along 
            the x and y axes.  If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis.
            (transform: skew(15deg, 4deg)).</div>
        <div>Change Origin of Transform - can control the origin from which your transforms are 
            applied using the property transform-origin.  It is the same syntax as the background-positon 
            property and defaults to the center of the object.  A circle or ellipse rotating 180 degrees
            would look the same.  Use transform-origin of 10% 10% or top center, you would notice the 
            rotation. (Default is 50% 50%).  ** choose ordering carefully - the order of the functions
            matters.  If you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated
            axis **</div>
        <div>Transitions - allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, providing
            simple animations.  You can have a link color change on hover and have it gradually fade
            from one color to other, instead of a sudden change.  When we animate any of the transformations,
            our pages feel more dynamic.  CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on
            an element.  When the target properties change, the browser will apply the transition making
            the change gradual.  Steps are - 1. Declare the original state of the element in the default 
            style declaration 2. Declare the final state of your transitioned element (ex. :hover) 3.
            Include the transition functions in your default style using the transition properties (ex.
            transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay).
            Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid midpoint can 
            be transitioned. (1px border to 15px bord is 8px, changing from a solid to dashed border-style
            has no midpoint and can't be transitioned.)  The transition-property has no effect until
            you set the transition-duration property.  That sets how long the transition will take, 
            specify in seconds (s) or miliseconds (ms).  The transition-timing-function property lets 
            you control the pace of the transition using key terms: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or
            ease-in-out.  The property transition-delay prevents the transition from beginning immediately.
            The shorthand for 4 lines of is - transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms; - the properties
            can be in any order, except - when you have a delay you must include a duration before the delay.</div>
        <div>Animations - CSS animation allow you control over each step of an animation through 
            keyframes.  You first create a named animation, then attach ot to an element in that element's 
            property declaration block.  Use the rule @keyframes before your animation name.  Each keyframe 
            looks like its own nested CSS declaration block.  Keyterms from and to specify how far 
            along the animation each keyframe is located.  Include the properties you want to animate 
            along with the values.  Keyframes can be specified in any order, the percentage values determine 
            the sequence of the keyframes.  The animation-delay property defines how many miliseconds or 
            seconds to wait before the browser can begin the animation.  The animation-fill-mode property 
            defines what happens before the first animation and after the last animation.  The available 
            values are: none, forwards, backwards, or both.  The shorthand property for animations is 
            a list separated by a space between each value.  Do NOT name your animation-name with: forwards,
            running, or alternate.</div>

      <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
      <p>With Canvas API, you can draw with JavaScript.  You can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, 
        gradients and patterns.  You can manipulate pixels in images and video.  The first step is to add 
        a canvas element to the page, give it an id to grab the element from the DOM.  And it needs both 
        a width and height attribute. (canvas id='myCanvas' class='myCanvas' width='200' height='200').
        The context is the place where your drawing is rendered.  Obtain your drawing by calling the 
        getContext method and pass it the string '2d'.  Use strokeStyle or fillStyle properties take either:
        string representing a color, CanvasGradient object, or CanvasPattern object.  Use a coordinate
        system to draw.  The top-left corner is (0,0), if the canvas is 200 px by 200 pixels, the
        bottom-right corner is (200,200).  You can create a CanvasPatttern by calling the createPattern
        method, which takes two parameters - the image to create the pattern with and how that image 
        should be repeated.  Gradients can also be added using createLinearGradient() or createRadialGradient()
        and add colors.  Then use addColorStop() to finish.  You can draw other shapes too and add images.
        Images can then be manipulated.  You can add color to images or turn them to black and white.  Video
        can also be manipulated.
        <div>SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics is a file format that preserves the quality when you 
            blow up their size or shrink them.  You can draw shapes in SVG, but it is a lot of code
            or use an open source tool to make SVG images.</div>
        <div>Canvas vs VSG - Canvas operates in immediate mode, it no longer has access to the shape 
            so you can't modify it.  There's no access on the canvas through the DOM, which makes it 
            faster.  SVG is retained mode, the image is preserved, but you can't manipulate the pixels
            like you can in canvas.</div>
        <div>Drag and Drop API - draggable is not a Boolean attribute, so you have to set it to true.  Use 
            DataTransfer to pass data from your dragged items to the drop target.</div>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>I don't have direct questions on transforms, transitions and animations.  It was a lot of
        information that made sense, the trick will be to use it often enough to remember it all and 
        how each piece of it affects the page.  In the section Canvas, adding the canvas element, it 
        shows var canvas = document.getElementById... Why use var?  Is this older information that still
        is using var?  Should it be const instead of var? Does it matter?
