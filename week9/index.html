    <h2>Notes - Javascript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
      <h3>The Window Object</h3>
      <p>Every JavaScript environment has a global object.  In a browser environment the global 
        object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.
        The Browser Object Model, or BOM, is a collection of properties and methods that contain 
        information about the browser and computer screen.  You can find out which browser is being
        used to view it, the dimensions of the screen, and which pages have been visited before.  You
        can also create annoying pop-up windows.
        <div>Dialogs - 3 functions supported as methods in the window object are: alert(), confirm(),
          and prompt().  Window.alert() will pause the execution of the program and display a message
          in the dialog box.  Window.confirm() will stop the execution of the program and display a 
          confirmation dialog with a message as an argument, boolean value true if OK and false if 
          it is Cancel.  Window.prompt() will stop the execution of the program and displays a message 
          provided as an argument and a field that allows the user to enter text.</div>
        <div>Browser Information - the window object has a navigator property that returns a 
          reference to the navigator object which contains information about the browser being used.  
          Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being 
          used.  This information isn't reliable.  The window.location property is an object that 
          contains information about the URL of the current page.  The href property returns the 
          full URL as a string.  The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol 
          being used (http:, https:, pop2, ftp).  The host property returns a single string describing
          the domain of current URL and port number.  The hostname property returns a string describing 
          the domain of the current URL.  The port property returns a string describing the port number.
          The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain.  The search 
          property returns a string that starts with a "?" followed by the query string parameters.
          The has property returns a string that starts with a "#" followed by the fragment identifier.
          The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol adn domain where the current page 
          originated from.  The window.location() object has these methods: reload() to force a reload of
          the current page, assign() used to load another resource from a URL, replace() loads another
          source from a URL but doesn't store in the session history, toString() returns a toString
          containg the whole URL.  The Browser History - window.history used to access information 
          about previously visited pages, window.history.length shows how many pages have ben visited 
          before arrriving at current page, window.history.go() used to go to a specific page where
          0 is the current page.  You can also navigate forward or backward a page using window.history.forward()
          or window.history.back().</div>
        <div>Controlling Windows - a new window can be opened using window.open() method, the 
          URL of the page to be opened is the first parameter, the window title the second, a list
          of attributes as the third.</div>
        <div>The Document Object - the method write() simply writes a string of text to the page.  The 
          document.write() method can also be used in the document inside script tags to interject a 
          string into the markup.  This shouldn't be used as it mixing JavaScript with HTML.  Cookies 
          are small files saved locally on a computer used to keep track of user choices.  To create 
          a cookie, you assign it using the document.cookie property like document.cookie = 'hero=true'. 
          The value can be changed by reassigning the same name, but different value.  You can split the 
          string into an array containing each name/value pair using the split method and a for of loop
          to iterate through the array.  Cookies are deleted once a browser session is finished by default.
          Adding '; expires=date' to the end of the cookie when it's set makes it persistent.  The date is in 
          the UTC String format of Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT.  For security reasons, the 
          cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain that the file 
          was set.  Adding the string ; secure to the end of the cooke will ensure it's only transmitted
          over a secure HTTP network.  To remove a cooke, set it to expire at a time in the past.
          If the cookie is a session cookie, it will expire when the tab or window is closed.</div>
        <div>Timing Functions / Set Interval - the window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as 
          its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.  Cancelling the 
          timeout, use window.clearTimeout() method.  The window.setInterval() method is like the timeout 
          method except it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of 
          milliseconds.  Be careful using the this keyword with timing methods!</div>
        <div>Animation - you can animate elements on a web page by using the setTimeout() and 
          setInterval() methods.
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>HTML5 APIs </h3>
      <p>Web Storage - the Web Storage API is a key-value storage on the client's 
        computer like cookies, but with fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and easier to use.
        Here you can store information about users and application-specific information that can be
        used in future sessions.  The differences that Web Storage API has from cookies are: Information 
        stored is NOT shared with the server on every request, Information is available in multiple 
        windows, but only if the domain is the same, Storage capacity is larger than cookies, Any 
        data stored doesn't automatically expire like cookies.  To save a value locally, use 
        localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White'); rather than using the setItem() and getItem()
        methods, can use assignment and reference localStorage.name like it is a variable to change 
        its value.  localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg';  Then to remove it, localeStorage.removeItem('name');
        You can also use the delete localeStorage.name; operator.  To completely remove everything 
        in local storage, use the clear() method.  The properties are: key - tells if the key of the 
        item that changed, newValue - tells the new value to which it has been changed, oldValue - tells 
        the previous value before it was changed, storageArea - tells if it stored in a local or 
        session storage.  The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.
        It can find the exact location of the user and then using nearby places, measure the speed 
        the user is moving.  Permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.  Use the 
        method getCurrentPosition() that will return a postion object to the specified callback 
        function, which could be called youAreHere().  The position function passes the coords
        property with a latitude and longitude property to give the coordinates of the device.
        <div>Web Workers - allow processes to be run in the background.  Any process that could 
          take a long time are carried out in the background so a website will continue to function 
          without the page becoming unresponsive.  To start, create a new work using the constructor 
          function Worker(). (See in the examples file).  These are dedicated web workers.  They
          are linked to the script that loaded the worker and can't be used by another script.  You can 
          also create shared web workers that allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to 
          access the worker.  The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background 
          and be able to intercept network requests.  Websocket is a new protocol that allows 
          two-way communication with a server, known as push messaging.  The connection is kept open 
          and responses are pushed to the client as soon as they are received.  The Notification API
          allows you to show messages using the system's notifications.  Multimedia runs without Flash
          using audio and video tags to insert audio and video clips into a web page.  You use the src 
          attribute to point to the audio file.  The same is used for video.  Any content inside these 
          tags will display only if the browser doesn't support them.  The controls attribute an be 
          added and will display the browser's native controls like play, pause, volume, etc.</div>
        <div>Drawing with Canvas - canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page.  It has 
          a corrdinate system that starts (0,0) in the top-left corner and can be accessed by using its method.
          const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');  Fill and stroke colors are 
          changed using CSS to the fillStyle and strokeStyle properties.  Set the lineWidth property, 
          which defaults to 1px and remains the same until changed.  The fillRect() method can draw 
          a filled-in rectangle.  The strokeRect() method produces a not filled in rectangle.  Straight
          lines are drawn using moveTo() and lineTo() methods.  Nothing is drawn on the canvas until 
          the stroke() method is called.</div>
      </p>
      <h3>Modern Frontend Development Workflow</h3>
      <p>Tools to help - Package Mananger - track all the external dependencies.  The development 
        tools and libraries we might be using.  It know which packages to download and tracks the 
        version as well.  (npm).  Bundlers - handle the compiling, transpiling, concatinating, minifying,
        and moving around of assets in the project.  (Parcel, Webpack).  Task Managers - track what
        needs to be done and when.  Generally scripts are defined in the task manager for each phase
        of development.  (npm, Grunt, Gulp).

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>Is geolocation used in the Pokemon Go game?  Is it also used for applications that search
        for restaurants or shopping "near me"?  Otherwise, this week's concepts make sense to me,
        I'm just not sure how I will use web workers or canvas drawing in the future.
