      <h3>Remembering User's Info</h3>
      <p>True communication is bidirectional, there needs to be a way for the user to communicate
        with you.  To get the user's input from any input or text area tag - use value.  When you
        want to show something to the user, use a section and innerHTML.</p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>How is localStorage used by sites other than tracking visits or holding the variable
        until the next time it is used?  What other ways can you store data?  How long are
        the variables stored?  Can you save multiple variables using key-value pairs?</p>

      <h3>Master Mobile UX video</h3>
      <p>Design for smallest, least powerful device first - you will focus on the content
        and core functionality. After 2011, paradigm shift from computers to mobile devices.
        Everything we build needs be viewable across all devices.  Mobile devices are about
        2-3 devices per person, per household.  Responsive retrofitting is better than a 
        re-write, but mobile come first.  Cause screen real estate and touch interaction 
        issues.  Start small and scale up, make sure your functionality works well on
        small devices.
        Make designs quick and easy, aim for 0 steps for user.  Think about hand grip of 
        device and the reachability.  Reduce images, use svg/webfonts, optimize and minify
        css and js files, use gzip files.
        Hamburger menu is not known by most users.
        Reduce cognitive load, no thinking.  Use autocomplete and eliminate as many fields
        as possible.  Password mistakes are large issue, credit card forms - auto advance.
        Keyboard available on forms make it easier.  Link your phone number instead of providing
        text that the use has to copy and paste.
        Don't use pop-ups and pop-overs, content first.</p>
