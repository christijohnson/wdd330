      <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
      <p>Types of errors - System Error - with system or external devices with which the program
        is interacting.  Programmer Error - incorrect syntax or faulty logic, or even a typo.  User
        Error - user entered data incorrectly, program can't handle it.  An exception is an error
        that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error, such
        as trying to call a method that is nonexistent.  Exceptions produce a stack trace, this is 
        a sequence of functions or methods that lead to a point where the error occured.  Stack 
        trace will work backwards from the point of error to identify the original function or 
        method that started the sequence.  Warnings occur is there's an error in the code, but
        doesn't cause the program to crash.  It can continue to run, but could be problematic.
        Problems could lurk in the background until they cause the program to crash spectacularly,
        silent errors are difficult to spot and track down.  Programmers should ensure the code
        will fail loudly in development so errors can be identified and fixed.  Then make the code
        fail gracefully in production.  This is accomplished by catching exceptions and testing
        the code rigorously.  Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings to prevent some of
        the deprecated features.  Writing code in strict mode can help improve clarity and speed
        and encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written.  You simply use the line of - 
        'use strict'; to be the first line of the JavaScript file.  If the engine doesn't support
        this mode, this line will be ignored.  Or you can just apply this mode to a function when
        it is the first line of the then block.
        <div>Debugging in Browser - basic form is the alert() method, this stops a program from 
        running until OK is clicked.  It is an effective way of putting breakpoints in the code
        that let us check the value of the variables at that point to see if they're what we expect
        them to be.  Other way is the console object which has a number of methods for logging information
        and debugging.  You use the console.log() method at different stages of the programming 
        and console.trace() will log an interactive stack trace in the console.
        </div>
        <div>Error Objects - error objects can be created by the host environment when an exception 
        occurs, or created in the code using a constructor function - const error = new Error('Oops,
        something went wrong');  Other object errors are: RangeError - when number is outside the 
        allowable range of values, ReferenceError - when a reference is made to an item that doesn't 
        exist, SyntaxError - error in syntax, TypeError - error in type of value used like a string 
        when a number is expected, URIError - problem encoding or decoding URI, InternalError - the 
        non-standard error in the JavaScript engine.  Custom error objects can be constructed like,
        const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');
        </div>
        <div>Exception Handling - how you catch errors while they are hidden from the user, and keep
        the program running.  You use the try, catch, and finally block.  If there is an error in 
        the try block, the code in the catch block will run.  Can add a finally block that will
        be executed after the try or catch block, whether an exception occured or not.
        </div>
        <div>Test-driven Development (TDD) - process of writting tests before any code.  Then write
        code that will pass the tests.  You can refactor the code to make it faster, more readable,
        and remove repetition.  The steps - 1. Write test that initially fail  2. Write code to
        pass the tests  3. Refractor the code  4. Test refactored code  5. Write more tests for 
        new features.  Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook.  First it needs to be installed
        by entering npm install -g jest in the command in a terminal and tested by running
        jest -v.  If a version number is returned, it has been installed correctly.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>Do you use the 'use strict' mode for writing code? Is it better used by an experienced
        programmer than a novice?  I have written tests before, to test my coding.  I can't wrap 
        my mind around how to write tests before the code (using TDD).  Have you ever coded like 
        this before?  Wouldn't you have to have some basic code established to know what tests to 
        write?
