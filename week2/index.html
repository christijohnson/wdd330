      <h3>Programming Basics - variables, scope, converting/parsing, template literals</h3>
      <p>There are reserved words that are used by JavaScript language that cannot be used
        as variable names, others that weren't reserved that should have been.
        Primitive Data Types - string, symbol, number, boolean, undefined, null - all other
        values are objects (like array, function, object literals).  Use operator of "typeof"
        to determine the value.
        <div>Variables - must be declared before they can be used. "const" is used when the variable
        won't be assigned to another value (primitive data) and "let" is used if it might be reassigned later.</div>
        <div>Scope - refers to where the constant or variable are accessible by the program. If the variable
        is block scoped it is only available in the local scope.  If the variable is declared
        outside a block it has global scope, or is accessible everywhere in the program.  This 
        can cause issues and potentially overwrite other values.</div>
        <div>Backslashes - used to escape special characters in strings: single quote \', double quote \",
        end of line \n, carriage return \r, tab \t, if backslash \\.</div>
        <div>Call a method - use dot operator followed by name of method, followed by parentheses.</div>
        <div>Template literals - use backtick character, expressions in curly brace with $ character in front.</div>
        <div>To check and see if a number is valid, use method Number.isInterger to check.</div>
        <div>Operations - add, sub, mult *, div /, expon **, remaind %</div>
        <div>Increase value - compound assignment operator of +=, decrease -=, double *=, divide /=,
        change to remainder %=</div>
        <div>Check a value is number - Number.isFinite()</div>
        <div>Parsing Number - use function parseInt() to convert string back to a number, specify
        base of the number, can use to ignore letters after number, with a decimal will remove
        anything after the decial point, use parseFloat() convert string into floating point decimal.</div>
        <div>Logical Operators - not !, and &&, or ||</div>
        <div>Equality - soft equality ==, hard equality ===, or soft inequality !=, hard 
        inequality !==</div>
      </p>
      <h3>Arrays, Logic, and Loops - array methods</h3>
      <p>Arrays are an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets, are an object. You
        can add values to array by arrayName [0] = 'value'.  You can create the array literal
        so you don't have to add each one, and they can be different types.  To remove item use
        the delete operator, but it leaves an undefined value.  To remove the last item,use pop() method, to remove the first item,
        use the shift() method.  To append a new value to the end of the array, use the push()
        method, and append to the beginning use the unshift() method. The slice() method creates
        a subaray, and splice() removes an item and replaces it with another.  You can find the 
        value of an item using indexof() method.
        <div>Maps - ordered lists of key-value pairs, like a dictionary.  Maps can use any data type
        as a key.  You can find the number of key-value pairs using the size property, to retrieve
        values, use the get() method.  Create a map object using new operator and Map() constructor,
        const romanNumerals = new Map();.  To look up a value, use get() method, to remove use
        delete() method, clear() method removes all key-value pairs.</div>
        <div>Logic - if statement, the code inside the block will only run if the condition inside
        the parentheses is true.  - else statement, alternate block of code to run if the condition
        is false.  - switch statement, instead of writing a string of else if statements, use 
        switch operator with the value to compare in parentheses, then case for each possible
        keyword followed by the code than runs if true, finish each block with break to stop
        evaluing the statement.  If none of cases are true, default key provides the code.</div>
        <div>Loops - repeat a piece of code over and over per conditions.  - while loop, run
        a block of code while conditions are true.  - for loop, condition has to be met for the 
        loop to continue the code is what to do after each iteration, for loops can be nested.
        </div>

      <h3>Functions - functions and callbacks</h3>
      <p>Function is code that can be referenced by name, like a small mini-program, help
        reduce repetition and make code easier to follow.
      <div>Function Declaration - starts with keyword function, followed by name, then
        parentheses, then the block of code.</div>
      <div>Function Expression - assigns an anonymous funcion to a variable, = function() then
        the block of code.</div>
        Invoking a function - to run the code inside the function body, simply enter name
        followed by parentheses, like hello(); no repeated blocks of code and when you change
        it, only have to update it once.  Known as DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).  Functions
        return a value, can be specified using return statement.  You set the parameters a function
        needs when the function is defined.  When the function is invoked, it is provided arguments.
      <div>Arrow Functions, declare function using less verbose syntax.  They are identified
        by the arrow symbol =>, the parameters come before the arrow and main body comes 
        after.  These functions are always anonymous, to refer to them they must be assigned
        a variable.  const square = x => x*x;  The advantages - less verbose, single parameters
        don't need parentheses, body doesn't go inside a block if it is only one line, keyword
        return isn't required if it is the only statement.  Longer functions still require curly
        braces to deliminate the body and keyword return at the end.</div>
      <div>Function Hoisting - action of moving all variable and function declarations to
        top of the current scope.  Functions defined using function declaration are automatically
        hoisted, or can be invoked before they are defined.</div>
      <div>Callbacks - a function that is passed as an argument to another function.  The callback
        is provided as a paramenter, then invoked inside the body of the function.</div>
        forEach method - loop through array and invoke callback function using each value
        as an argument.  Callback function requires 3 parameters.  1st - represents value
        in the array, 2nd - represents current index, 3rd - represents the array that the callback
        is being called on.  - map method is similiar, used to process data returned from databases
        in array form, adding HTML tags, difference is it returns a new array that replaces
        each value with the return value.  - reduce method, iterates over each value but 
        cumulatively combines each result to return a single value.  - filter method returns a
        new array that only contains items from the original array that return true when passed
        to the callback.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>I don't understand Symbol and its use, either as an uniqueID or as a shared symbol.  Is this
        value not used much in JavaScript or do I need to add this to my skill set? I've never used it before.  What
        is the difference between an array and a set?  They seems very similiar, with different
        operators.  Why would you create a set and then convert to an array? Or convert a map to
        an array?
