      <h3>Validating Forms</h3>
      <p>Validate data on the client-side to ensure that the required forms are completed and correct.  
        It is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience.  Catching and fixing
        data on the client side helps speed up the process by removing the delay it takes for the data 
        to make a round-trip to the server and back for validation.  Server side checks should also 
        be done because client-side validation is easy to bypass.  When completing an on-line form 
        the feedback you get when you enter, or don't enter, the data is form validation.  Examples 
        are required fields, phone number or date format, valid email, or password requirements.  When 
        you enter data, the browser and/or web server checks to see that the data is in the correct 
        format and within the constraints.  If the information is formatted correctly, the application 
        allows the data to be submitted to the server and saved in a database.  If the information is 
        incorrect, the user gets an error message and the user can try again.  The reasons for validating 
        our forms are: to get the right data in the right format, to protect the users' data, to 
        protect ourselves. 
        <div>Types - JavaScript is completely customizable, but you have to create it all or use a library.  
            Built-in form validation uses HTML validation features, this has better performance but it 
            isn't customizable.  Validation attributes include: required (whether a form needs to be filled
            in before the form can be submitted), minlength/maxlength (min and max length of textual data, or
            string), min/max (min and max value of numerical input types), type (whether data needs to be a 
            number, email, or other specific preset type), pattern (regular expression that defines a pattern 
            that the data needs to follow).  Data entered in a field that follows the rules specified in 
            the attributes is considered valid, otherwise is considered invalid.  When the element matches - 
            you can apply a specific style using the :valid CSS pseudo-class and the form will be submitted 
            unless there is something else stopping it.  When the element is invalid you can apply the CSS 
            pseudo-class of :invalid to it and the browser will block the form and display an error message.</div>
        <div>Required Attribute - to make an input mandatory, add required to the element.  When this attribute 
            is set it matches the :required pseudo-class and the form won't submit and an error message is 
            displayed.  The same happens when the input is empty, it is considered invalid.</div>
        <div>Pattern - this validation feature expects a regular expression as a value.  A regular expression 
            is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings.  Some examples 
            are: a (matches one character that is not a), abc (matches a, followed by b, followed by c), ab?c 
            (matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c like ac or abc), ab*c (matches a, 
            optionally followed by any number of b s, followed by c - like ac, abc, abbbbbc), a|b (matches one 
            character that is a or b), abc|xyz (matches exactly abc or xyz - not abcxyz or a or y).</div>
        <div>Constraining - Length of entries - you can constrain the character length in text field with input or 
            textarea by using minlength and maxlength.  Better user experiences use just maxlength and a 
            character count feedback.  Value of entries - number fields with input type="number", use min and max
            attributes to provide a range of valid values.</div>
        <div>Validation using JavaScript - Constraint Validation API - set of methods and properties 
            available on DOM interfaces: HTMLButtonElement, HTMLFieldSetElement, HTMLInputElement, HTMLOutputElement,
            HTMLSelectElement, HTMLTextAreaElement.  The constraint validation API properties: validationMessage (returns 
            a localized message about the constraints that aren't satisfied - if valid will return an empty string).  
            validity (returns ValidityState object that contains several properties describing the state of 
            the element).  The more common ones: patternMismatch (returns true if doesn't match and false if matched), 
            tooLong (returns true if value longer than max length, or false if shorter than or equal to the 
            max length), tooShort (returns true if value is shorter than min length or false if greater than or 
            equal to the min length), rangeOverflow (returns ture if value is greater than the max or false if 
            less than or equal to max value), rangeUnderflow (returns true if value is less than the min or false if it 
            is greater than or equal to min value), typeMismatch (returns true if value not in the required syntax - like 
            email or url - or false if syntax is correct), valid (returns true if element meets all validation 
            constraints, or false if it fails any constraint), valueMissing (returns ture if element has a required 
            attribute but no value, or false otherwise), willValidate (returns true if element will be validated when 
            the form is submitted, or false otherwise).  The Constraint Validation API makes these methods 
            availabe in the form element: checkValidity() - returns true if element's value has no validity problems, false
            otherwise.  reportValidity() - reports invalid field(s) using events.  This is useful in 
            combination with preventDefault() in a onSubmit event handler.  setCustomValidity(message) - adds 
            a custom error message to the element.  (in example) store a reference to the email input and add an 
            event listener so that it runs the contained code each time the value inside the input is changed.  We 
            check to see if the input property returns true (the contained value doesn't match the pattern for a well-formed 
            email address).  If so the setCustomValidity method is called with a custom message which is 
            displayed.  It renders the input invalid, so the submission fails and the error message is displayed.</div>
        <div>If you don't want to use the Constraint Validation API, you can still use JavaScript, but you will 
            have to write your own.  Ask yourself these questions: What kind of validation should I perform? (How to
            validate data - string operations, type conversion, regular expression, etc.).  What should I do if the 
            form doesn't validate? (Does the form send data anyway?  Should I highlight the fields in error?  Should I 
            display an error message?).  How can I help the user to correct invalid data? (Provide as much helpful 
            information as possible, offer up-front suggestions, and clear error messages).</div>
      </p>
      <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
      <p>The Fetch API provides JavaScript an interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol
        like requests and responses.  It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical 
        way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.  Fetch specifications differ by: Promise returned
        from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status.  When the server responses with headers, the Promise will 
        resolve normally, unless fetch() is called with credentails option set to include, fetch() - it won't send 
        cookies in cross-origin requests, won't set any cookies sent back in cross-origin responses.  (in example) fetching
        a JSON file across the network and printing to the console.  Simplest use of fetch() takes one 
        argument - the path of the resource to fetch - doesn't directly return the JSON response, but instead 
        a promise that resolves with a response object.  That object doesn't directly contain the JSON 
        response body, but a representation of the entire HTTP response.  To extract the JSON body from the 
        response object, we use the json() method - which returns with a second promise that resolves 
        with the parsing of the response body text.  The fetch() method can accept a second parameter, an init 
        object that allows you to control different settings.
        <div>Headers - this interface allows you to create your own headers object using the Headers() 
            constructor.  The headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values.  Headers can be sent 
            in requests and received in responses - have various limitations - header's objects have a 
            guard property.  Possible guards are: none (default), request (guard for headers object), 
            request-no-cors (guard for headers object obtained from request created with request.mode), response (guard 
            for a headers object obtained from a response), immutable (guard that renders a headers object 
            read-only)</div>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>No questions this week.  I'm not super comfortable with the Fetch API and json() methods.  I know that 
        the more I use it, the more comfortable I will become.  In the section about Headers and Guards,
        I not sure that I know how to use the guard properties to my benefit.
